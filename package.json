Our main focus will be to bring people together by giving them a platform to create, rate, and comment on memes generated by other users.  With this easy-to-navigate interface, users can upload their own pictures and make them a meme, caption an existing meme from our database, browse through a gallery of uploaded memes by other users, or simply communicate with the online community through our comment section.",
